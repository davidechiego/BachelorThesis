# BachelorThesis
My Bachelor's thesis on the classical limit of Quantum Mechanics in a Quantum-revised version of the Hamilton-Jacobi formulation.

This review thesis has been inspired by the following pubblications of Prof. M.F. Girard from the University of Salerno:

* "Numerical Solutions of the Quantum Hamilton-Jacobi Equation and Exact
 WKB-Like Representation of One-Dimensional Wave Functions" (https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1403.0825)

* "Analytical Solutions of the Quantum Hamilton-Jacobi Equation and Exact WKB-Like Representations of One-Dimensional Wave Functions" (https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1512.01356)

In this work of revision and commentary, I derived the analytical and numerical results again and presented them in an extended way.
