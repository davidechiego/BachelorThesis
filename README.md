# BachelorThesis
Written in Italian during my last year at the University of Pisa.


My Bachelor's thesis focused on the classical limit of Quantum Mechanics from the point of view of a Quantum-revised version of the Hamilton-Jacobi formulation.
This review thesis was based on the following pubblications by Prof. M.F. Girard of the University of Salerno:

* "Numerical Solutions of the Quantum Hamilton-Jacobi Equation and Exact WKB-Like Representation of One-Dimensional Wave Functions" (https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1403.0825)

* "Analytical Solutions of the Quantum Hamilton-Jacobi Equation and Exact WKB-Like Representations of One-Dimensional Wave Functions" (https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1512.01356)

In this work of revision and commentary, I derived the analytical and numerical results again and presented them in an extended way.
